                        Camplipong is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines our
                        ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information. We have
                        adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the
                        Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and
                        dispose of your Personal Information. A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be
                        obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at

                    <p>
                        Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of
                        Personal Information we collect includes names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile
                        numbers. We donâ€™t guarantee website links or policy of authorised third parties. We collect your
                        Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, providing
                        information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for
                        secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would
                        reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists
                        at any time by contacting us in writing. When we collect Personal Information we will, where
                        appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we are collecting the information and how we
                        plan to use it.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="mt-4  text-lg font-bold">Third Parties</h3>
                    <p>
                        Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from
                        you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In
                        such a case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information
                        provided to us by the third party.
                    </p>

                        and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. When your Personal Information is no
                        longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to
                        destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most of the Personal
                        Information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a minimum of 7
                        years.
